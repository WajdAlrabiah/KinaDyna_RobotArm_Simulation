# KinaDyna_RobotArm_Simulation
A Python-based project for visualizing and analyzing 3D rotations and inverse kinematics of a 2-link robotic arm. The project demonstrates the use of rotation matrices around different axes, combined transformations, and inverse kinematics calculations for reaching target positions. It includes 3D visualizations using Matplotlib.
